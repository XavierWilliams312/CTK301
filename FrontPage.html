				About me
			</h2>
			<p> Hello, My name is Xavier, or some others may call me Zay as an nickname. I major in Creative Technologies Game Design at Illinois State University. I tend to watch animes or common known shows time to time to keep up with the shown shows. I also work on games under a company called "Roblox" which a lot of people tend to play next to minecraft. I'm very terrible at math, so please don't ask me for help when it comes to math Por Favor? I usually tend to help others with any issues really, it's just that trust nowadays is pretty bad for people to actually trust you properly without that doubt in their mind. </p>
